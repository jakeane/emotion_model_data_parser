Yeah he got caught in someones pics on Facebook. Never lie and then go out with people who like to take pictures.	sad	0.9904

My friend's boyfriend recently made a pass at me. I'm married, and I also am really good friend's with his girlfriend so I felt really bad. I made sure he knew I was loyal and honest to both!	faithful	0.9999				
I struggled with it, but my friend was in a really bad spot, with no income and raising her grandchild, he was the financial supporter. So, I didn't tell her, as I knew it would really hurt her in several ways, plus she really loves him!	guilty	0.9992

i was thinking about it! I wanted to join a group for local moms	caring	0.9977

Me either! I have two of my own children, and I would have never let them get away with that kind of behavior when they were his age. I just don't understand those kind of parents!	furious	0.9996

I recently spoke with my ex-girlfriend on the phone. The conversation went pretty well, and it reminded me of my past experiences with her.	nostalgic	0.8958	ashamed	0.0577		
Yes, they ended somewhat well, but there were tense moments. I am glad she's doing well, but I miss her.	sad	0.9886				
Thank you! That means a lot.	ashamed	0.9998				
One of the times I remember feeling the most blissed out in life was right after the birth of my first child.	joyful	0.9731				
Obviously there are the demands of a new child -- but that feeling of finally meeting someone you waited so long for, and the love surrounding the whole situation. Truly something to remember.	joyful	1.0000				
Have you ever been in a situation when payment of some kind has come through *just* in the nick of time?! Talk about gratitude!	grateful	0.9998

Im so grateful for my family due to an incident with my friend	grateful	1.0000				
My friend lost her parents and siblings in a fire and their family was very close to mine. So seeing her go through the grief made me realize how thankful I should be	caring	0.9991				
Yes definitely. Never take anything for granted as you never know when it will be taken away from you	surprised	0.9914				
I'm a big believer in listening to your gut. Sometimes I might wonder where my intuition is leading me, but it always seems to be spot on.	faithful	0.7538	trusting	0.2230		
It is a "knowing" -- and a flowing! When something is right, it just feels easier to go with it -- like you're being led, even if you might not fully know to where.	hopeful	0.4013	content	0.2181	confident	0.1255
I couldnt celebrate my 18th birthday as I had exams during the time and I felt terrible for it. But my friends threw a surprise party for me and it was the best!	surprised	0.9955

I feel lonely sometimes cause I live in a house with 5 girls and all of them have boyfriends and sometimes they are all hanging out with their significant others and I feel lonely	lonely	1.0000				
Sometimes they joke about it and obviously I make it look like its totally fine cause I dont want to give them the impression that I am lonely but it does hurt sometimes	lonely	1.0000				
As silly as it sounds, I was so surprised at how different my two kids were as babies. You're reminded that they're wired with their own personalities from the git-go.	impressed	0.9918				
One was pacifier, one was fingers. One wanted to co-sleep, one liked her space. One liked facing *out* in the Baby Bjorn carrier, one liked cocooning in a sling!	joyful	0.9701				
The other day I had a deep craving for Chik-Fil-A.	sad	0.9963				
Mine too. So I drive there and pull in the parking lot and it's completely empty. I then realized it was Sunday.	lonely	0.9999				
I visited an orphan once and it was such a surreal moment. It made me realise how thankful I should be for a family	sentimental	0.8386	grateful	0.1577		
Yes it definitely was. I went with intentions to teach the kid a few things but I ended up learning lots more from him	disgusted	0.8490				
My oldest and my husband have always had a rough relationship. I've got to believe that as she gets older, it will get better!	hopeful	0.9613				
That's always good to hear. But in the moment -- argh, my *heart*. How did your mom maneuver the differences between y'all? Did that wear on her?	trusting	0.9992				
But in the meantime -- the unspoken strain is NOT fun. But I'm glad to hear about a happy ending -- thank you for that!	faithful	0.9938				
I can still look back with shame at the way I treated a girl in sixth grade. I wasn't as bad as others, but that doesn't make me feel any better.	ashamed	1.0000				
Well, like a lot of 6th graders I was aware of *not* wanting to be an outcast for any reason. And unfortunately, she was. As an adult of course, my heart squeezes for *all* the kids we were!	anxious	0.9524				
Unfortunately, she died. I only found out when Facebook first came out, and her brother and I "friended" one another.	sad	0.3920	jealous	0.2863	lonely	0.2596
I'm currently working for someone that is *such* a great example of a leader! It makes going into work inspiring every day / every way.	impressed	0.9999				
That's a very kind statement, and certainly what I would strive for. And it's the rarity that *inspires* me. That should be the norm, not the exception! THAT'S what I'd like to inspire in people. How about you?	faithful	0.7938	hopeful	0.1607		
That is soul-sapping. What do you do to inspire yourself, and not let that kind of behavior drag you down?	proud	0.8499	excited	0.0683		
My friend's baby has grown so much since the last time I had seen her!	surprised	0.8103	joyful	0.1828		
It had been about 8 weeks - I don't get out her way often, even though we live 30 minutes away.	surprised	0.9911				
Yes!  I got to be 'auntie' for a bit and help change her and get her fed and down for a nap while my friend had a chance to toss laundry in the wash.  It was a good day for everyone!	caring	0.9959				
Running my first (and maybe only!) marathon felt like *such* a huge accomplishment!	joyful	0.7731	proud	0.2230		
Ah, it was the best! Plus it helped that I purposely chose an amazing destination in which to run it -- it was the Venice Marathon!	content	0.9942				
We were living overseas at the times -- the most impressive part was crossing the Grand Canal over a pontoon of boats to finish the marathon ;-)	impressed	1.0000				
I recently found out that a person I very much intimately admired did not feel the same way for me. I was pretty surprised.	faithful	0.7440	impressed	0.2157		
She just started treating me differently all of a sudden. And now she is going to be moving away soon.	sad	0.8316	devastated	0.1433		
I'm always appalled when I see bullying in action -- whether it's on a playground or political stage -- not much makes me angrier.	disgusted	0.9997				
How do you channel the anger? Obviously, it too easily turns into the same kind of negative emotion I'm upset about -- so that can feel hypocritical!	sad	0.8082	angry	0.1751		
Are you ever tempted to put anyone's face on the punching bag?! Ha! (Kidding/not kidding!)	annoyed	0.9926				
One morning my mother came to my house to pick my daughter up for school and told me she saw my daughter's cat on the road and he had been hit. I had to tell my daughter about the loss of her beloved pet.	sad	0.9215	devastated	0.0621		
She was around 11, so she took it very hard. I went ahead and let her stay home from school, as I knew she wouldn't do well that day.	trusting	0.9984				
I was soooo excited to take our kids to Disneyland for the first time!	nostalgic	0.6954	excited	0.3032		
Same! I was excited because I grew up going there. My grandparents lived in Tucson, and we would spend the summers with them -- the most exciting part being our drive to Disneyland each year!	excited	0.9678				
California! Old school ;-) They've kept so much of the original, while adding lots of new attractions.	nostalgic	0.9999				
I recently spoke to my father for the first time in years. It reminded me of my childhood and the distant past.	nostalgic	1.0000				
We spoke about our recent lives. Apparently he is in the market for a new car.	sentimental	0.7184	ashamed	0.1609	disappointed	0.0522
Do you like to organize your house.  My mother-in-law recently surprised me recently with some organizing stuff b/c she knows how much I love it!	surprised	0.9913				
Labels and Bins can be your best friend!  Especially with a new baby.	excited	0.9055	nostalgic	0.0714		
I find it odd -- and annoying -- when people don't respond to or even acknowledge emails.	annoyed	1.0000				
It would be great if there was a way we could all tell the best way to reach someone -- I know some people prefer texts to emails -- but if you're in a work situation, how do you ensure communication?	anticipating	0.9239				
I recently had a big argument with my sister. We both got very upset and angry at each other.	devastated	0.9996				
I'm not so sure. We just had a discussion that heated and became an argument with tempers flying.	terrified	0.7637	furious	0.1520		
I felt most lonely when we first moved overseas, my husband then had to travel out of *that* country for business -- AND I had a new baby!	lonely	1.0000				
From Santa Fe to Hong Kong -- ultimately a fantastic adventure. And I ended up with a wonderful group of friends. Expats bond quickly!	joyful	0.3124	surprised	0.3103	excited	0.2902
One of the saddest things to me is when people underestimate what they can do and/or are capable of.	disappointed	1.0000				
That's perfectly natural. You sound like the kind of person, though, that quickly regained their bearings. Disappointments like that usually come with some *good* lessons.	surprised	0.5967	disappointed	0.3962		
Once my husband asked me not to tell my mom that he was busy that day when she needed his help but I told her anyway.  I really felt bad b/c he got pretty upset with me.	guilty	0.9991				
Yeah thats a good question.  I totally deserved him being mad.  I just felt bad for him b/c he was so busy that day and I didn't want him to have one more thing on his plate I guess	guilty	1.0000				
There was a back neighbor that called my 10 year old son a ugly name one time, simply because he entered her yard slightly when he rode around the corner.!	disgusted	0.9848				
Yes, she lived several house back and she didn't know me, until after she did that! She knew me then, but after I talked to her, she apologized to both of us.	guilty	0.9992				
Too often, it's a health scare that makes us value health. It inspires me to try and do something to keep healthy every day.	excited	0.3120	confident	0.2248	nostalgic	0.1716
Happily, I don't have one! It's more seeing family and friends and the situations they're in. Not everything can be helped -- but there are some things we can all do to take care of ourselves, you know?	joyful	0.9627				
Every time I look through older photos of my children, I'm taken right back to the time they were that size, and what we were doing! It's a bittersweet feeling, for sure.	sentimental	0.9912				
Are your kids adults now?	anticipating	0.4449	grateful	0.2330	furious	0.1722
I have an 18 year old as well -- I don't know about you, but it's hard to consider her an adult sometimes!	caring	0.6497	sentimental	0.2078	trusting	0.1084
I have a hard time having confidence in myself but when I got married and I had my hair and makeup done I felt like I was beautiful!  I had so much confidence in myself that day and it was great!	confident	0.9999				
I really try but it's hard to replicate that day for sure.	nostalgic	0.9406				
My husband and I both work for ourselves -- a blessing and a curse at times, since it can be tough to determine a "regular" income.	grateful	0.9784				
We found a pretty good balance in that I have a part-time job that I *love* -- and that comes with benefits like insurance. That's a big worry addressed, right there.	hopeful	0.9626				
I am sorry, because I absolutely know that concern. I truly hope you find a resolution to that.	grateful	0.2962	guilty	0.2889	angry	0.2680

Well, right after she gave me a big hug, she introduced me to her new boyfriend.	surprised	0.7658	jealous	0.1676	embarrassed	0.0629
I know right! No warning or anything. He turned out to be a nice guy, but I thought it was a little misleading on her part.	apprehensive	0.8008	trusting	0.1788		
My family and I are going on vacation in a few weeks. We rented a largo beachfront condo and I can't wait!	excited	0.9978				
We are going to be staying at Miramar Beach in Florida, about an  hour Panama City Beach. The view is amazing from our balcony and we are so ready!	excited	0.9909				
I was supposed to go for brunch with my friend Maria the other day. At least that was the plan.	disappointed	0.7881	guilty	0.1855		
Well, we had initially agreed to meet at 11. Wouldn't you know it, she didn't end up returning my text until 3PM!	anticipating	0.7005	disappointed	0.2002		
Me and my mom were at this grocery store recently and this guy started following us outside the store and then again inside the store it was so scary!	terrified	0.9401	afraid	0.0598		
Well I knew he was following us and so I asked the manager to walk us out to the car and when he did we saw the guy come out again from between the two buildings b/c he was waiting on us.  so scary!	terrified	0.6141	afraid	0.3858		
Did I tell you what happened with Li the other night? Boy do I feel dumb.	embarrassed	0.9887				
She's 45 minutes late to our anniversary dinner. I don't know what happened to me but I called and left an angry message. Turns out, she had gotten T-boned at an intersection and was talking to the Police Officer when I called!	angry	0.9999				
Ugh! I looked like such a fool at my girlfriend's work party!	embarrassed	1.0000				
Well, I ended up having way too much to drink. One of her co-workers had a bottle of Fireball (gross I KNOW) and was making everybody do shots. I didn't want to look foolish, so I had... well too many.	embarrassed	0.9988				
Did I tell you what happened with the concert I was supposed to go to Saturday?	apprehensive	0.9163	disappointed	0.0820

Did I ever tell you about the time I "got taken hostage"?	terrified	0.9050	afraid	0.0939		
As a heart attack. It was me and Big C at the World's Largest Pistachio. All of the sudden we hear gunshots, and DiDi's still in the car. We ran in the building, and he comes flying in after us. He never pointed the gun at us, and we ended up running away when he was distracted. It's too crazy - I can't make this up. Just glad to be alive!	devastated	0.9882				
I went to visit a friend one day and her boyfriend made a pass at me. He actually suddenly kissed me, as I was waiting for my friend to return. I couldn't believe his nerve!	jealous	0.8963				
I quietly pushed him away, as I didn't want my friend to hear. I was so shocked and upset, since he knew I wouldn't want to make a scene and took advantage.	surprised	0.7153	embarrassed	0.1277	ashamed	0.1143
This past Friday night our refrigerator stopped cooling! We had to go the weekend without it, and of course had to deal with some unpleasant smells and throw away a large amount of food! It wasn't a fun weekend for us!	lonely	0.9699				
Yes, and of course we tried to call and have someone come out, but to no avail! You don't realize how much you rely on things like that until they aren't working!	furious	0.8208	devastated	0.0618	angry	0.0511
I felt pretty bad when I was having girl talk with my friend and we were talking about our partners. Her boyfriend had made a pass at me, but I never told her about it.	guilty	0.9934				
I felt bad, but she wasn't working and taking care of her grandchild, and her boyfriend was the financial support. I knew it would really be hard on her if she found out, not to mention she really loves him.	guilty	0.9980				
I was at the mall and hug my mom and said to her: Time to go Mommy! and i wasnt her, can you imagine my reaction to it?	embarrassed	0.9988

I am definitely a proud parent of our 15 year old -- she was determined to work this summer, and even with us saying no one would hire her until 16 -- she found a job!	proud	0.9976				
That, and she's enjoying the independence of having her own money. Remember that? Making money that you truly could use for your *pleasure* (and not just necessities?! ;-))	proud	0.9857				
Same! I was surprised 15 year olds *can* actually work during the summer. It's just finding an employer who knows those hours get cut WAY back once school starts.	impressed	0.9988				
Okay, a silly pet peeve but one nonetheless -- when people just leave their grocery carts willy-nilly in the parking lot. No consideration for others or the people who work at the store!	angry	0.9917				
Me too. And I will always make sure to at *least* put it in one of those cart corrals, if not walk it back up to the store. Hey -- extra exercise ;-)	prepared	0.9997

I love being in the "flow" -- whether it's in speaking to a group of people or working to help facilitate meetings.	confident	0.9248				
I work with different organizations on strengthening their culture, and I do large-scale visual notetaking (also known as graphic recording). Are you familiar with that at all? (Not unusual NOT to be!)	proud	0.9999				
That's one of the huge benefits -- learning about many different industries and subjects!	joyful	0.9987				
I LOVE when leaders know that it actually *helps* them to be surrounded by strong people -- people they can learn from, that challenge them, and that in some ways could be considered "better".	trusting	0.9395				
It's just too many leaders want "yes men" and/or people who feel non-threatening. It's a trap and a quick path to mediocrity, if not failure!	apprehensive	0.9964				
I'll always remember the day I learned I was pregnant with our first child -- Halloween in Chicago, and we were with friends at the Shedd Aquarium! I've loved baby belugas since ;-)	nostalgic	0.8078	excited	0.0999	joyful	0.0725

I was very surprised. She didn't tell a single person they were trying for a baby. Just announced it on the 4th of July	surprised	1.0000				
Yes, they put a picture of their sonogram on the tv and waited for someone to notice it. So exciting	proud	0.9968				
Oh no, what did you do instead? Did you watch Netflix?	content	0.5261	lonely	0.3867		
Yes, I do. I recently watched the series "Dark." It's the German one.	afraid	0.7190	sad	0.2658		
It's a supernatural mystery type. I won't spoil the twist.	apprehensive	0.8887	faithful	0.1002

When I was a kid, I went to this group with other kids my age, it was in a big gym. There were kids of different ages, and one of the kids (8 years old or so) was picking on the littler kids. So, when he had his back turned, I looped him with a hoola hoop and tripped him so he fell flat on his face.	impressed	0.9405				
Yeah, I was pretty amazed in the moment, he was flat as a board in mid air before he landed flat on his face. I had to watch for a moment in awe, before I realized he was getting up and I was about to get smacked. So, I ran towards where the parents were seated, stopped when I turned the corner, and walked calmly over to my mom, taking a seat on her lap. I looked innocent as could be as the mean kid came around the corner, and I forced myself to sit still so that when he smacked me in the face with the hoola hoop, I looked like a helpless victim.	impressed	1.0000
