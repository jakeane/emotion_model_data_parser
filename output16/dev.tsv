That is so exciting, congratulations! We moved 17 hours away from family, so having a great group of friends is really important to us.	1	hit:146_conv:293_3

I hope this doesn't make me sound like a horrible boyfriend, but when my girlfriend first moved into my house, I felt very apprehensive towards the move at first. I was used to it being one way, and she was changing everything. Took some getting used to.	3	hit:184_conv:368_1
I know. It caused some tension the first week or so. I had to take a deep breath, and realize its just things, and it was just me being reluctant to change.	3	hit:184_conv:368_3

It was a combination rice-cooker and vegetable steamer.  It looked so good in the ad, but when I got there, it looked cheap and shabby!	6	hit:3750_conv:7500_3
I hope I can find one that lives up to the promise of that ad.  Maybe somwhere else, right?	6	hit:3750_conv:7500_5

Unfortunately, I accidentally sent an email to a coworker essentially complaining about her attitude. I really wanted to dig myself in a hole and never come out.	10	hit:3790_conv:7581_1

Last year my wife got into an accident and we only had one car and I was so worried we wouldn't have a car to get to work	12	hit:4780_conv:9561_1

I keep hearing noises coming from my basement...	12	hit:4791_conv:9582_1
I want to, but I'm a bit scared. Maybe I should take something with me to defend myself, just in case.	12	hit:4791_conv:9582_3
I can't believe this! My son failed a really important test.	4	hit:4792_conv:9585_1
I sure hope so. Otherwise he might not be able to graduate.	4	hit:4792_conv:9585_3
It was a math test, it makes up a pretty large part of his grade.	4	hit:4792_conv:9585_5
They other day was my son's first day of school, and when I dropped him off it brought back so much memories.	14	hit:4794_conv:9588_1

I'm so ashamed of myself. I made a big mistake on a project for work.	2	hit:4805_conv:9610_1
It was something for an important client. Now I'm afraid this is going to screw up my career.	2	hit:4805_conv:9610_3
No, this is the first time I've messed up anything like this.	2	hit:4805_conv:9610_5
I bought a used car a few years ago and found 500 dollars tucked in the back seat!	7	hit:4807_conv:9615_1

My boyfriend told me he quit drinking, but I just found a bunch of empty liquor bottles he hid in his room.	0	hit:4832_conv:9664_1

If only it were that easy. It had several signatures on it.	10	hit:4868_conv:9737_5
There's a creepy guy that comes by at work that won't stop bothering me. He writes crazy letters, and keeps calling on the phone "just to chat" with me.	12	hit:4869_conv:9738_1

We had an annoying client the other day, and I went to the breakroom to complain about her to my coworkers (thinking she couldn't hear).	10	hit:4904_conv:9808_1

To be honest, I fell into a pretty deep depression. No one wanted to hire me. It was tough.	6	hit:4907_conv:9814_3

Well unfortunately the day before we were due to go my little 2 year old daughter woke up covered in spots.  As the day went on more and more appeared and she had a roaring temperature.  We realised she had chickenpox.  She was feeling so miserable and of course all she wanted was her mummy and daddy.  It was a bit depressing and part of me was devastated but our weekend away was not to be.  Sure kids always come first dont they?!	4	hit:4924_conv:9848_3
Very true and thats the way to look at it. I was a bit dispirited but the hotel were great and re-arranged it for us and to be honest I could never have left my baby when she was poorly. The best made plans dont always work out when you have kids, but hey I wouldnt change them for the world.	4	hit:4924_conv:9848_5

On my way back from a funeral, my friends and I almost got into a deadly car crash.	12	hit:8016_conv:16032_1
I think the other driver was falling asleep on the road. Out of nowhere, he moved onto the wrong lane directly towards us.	12	hit:8016_conv:16032_3
Agreed. I was so scared we could have been the ones in a casket that night.	12	hit:8016_conv:16032_5
I was so happy that after many years in retail I found a better job.	8	hit:8016_conv:16033_1

I lost my job earlier this year. I was really worried about how to pay my bills and finding a new job.	10	hit:8317_conv:16634_1
Well that's the cool thing... the week my unemployment ran out I got a job offer. At my former company, no less. So everything worked out!	10	hit:8317_conv:16634_3
Haha that's an awesome way to think about it!	10	hit:8317_conv:16634_5

I was! The guy was really nice and refused the cash I tried to give him as a reward.	7	hit:8331_conv:16663_3
Very! Lucky for me it was a cheap phone, I think if I had the newest iPhone or something I would have never seen it again.	7	hit:8331_conv:16663_5
I just got some new neighbors. I'm kinda nosy so I asked if I could take a look at how they decorated, just out of curiosity.	14	hit:8342_conv:16685_1
Nah, although I did consider brownies. They were happy to meet me so it was all good. But man I couldn't believe how nice their place looked compared to mine! I am a little jealous of their interior decorating skills.	14	hit:8342_conv:16685_3

Good suggestion! Really I wanted to keep all the signatures and notes from my friends but oh well. I will see them next month for our reunion anyway!	6	hit:8361_conv:16723_5
We've had our dog for over 8 years. He past away this spring.	6	hit:8368_conv:16737_1
It was sudden. He was completely fine when we went to bed. No issues at all. Its been hard for our daughter	6	hit:8368_conv:16737_3
I completely agree. I broke down just watching her cry at the spot where we buried him. I'm not sure if I want to get another dog yet. We have chickens so she's began to show them more attention now.	6	hit:8368_conv:16737_5

So it was supposed to rain, but when I got out it was beautifully sunny.	7	hit:9393_conv:18786_1
Sun is what makes me alive, so definitely yes.	7	hit:9393_conv:18786_3

Last week I was walking and talking to one of my coworkers and I stepped into a hole I did not see on the job site. I ended up falling and spilling hot coffee all over myself in front of our client.	10	hit:9444_conv:18888_1
Yeah, my coworker did, but the damage had already been done. Pretty big shot to the ego to look like such a fool in front of your client.	10	hit:9444_conv:18888_3
We have had a record number of tornadoes in my area so far this year. My son really hates going into the basement while it is storming outside.	12	hit:9445_conv:18890_1
He is only three, so it is pretty scary for him each time. I hate to see him that way.	12	hit:9445_conv:18890_3
I had a client meeting in Dallas, and as I was driving to the airport I heard there was going to be a lot of storms we'd be flying through. I ended up renting a car because I hate flying so much in just calm weather.	3	hit:9450_conv:18900_1

Last month, this area got pounded with rainfall. My entire home town was flooded and declared a disaster area.	11	hit:9457_conv:18915_1

My birthday isn't for another two weeks, but my wife gave me my gift early yesterday. She bought me a brand new laptop because mine was getting old and slow.	7	hit:9464_conv:18929_1

My ex took me to six flags and wanted me to ride on a very high roller coaster.	3	hit:9473_conv:18946_1

He went on disability.  He actually was my old roommate so I know he just doesnt like working but at the same time has anxiety issues so he can go that route to not get fired.  It definitely doesnt look good for him though.	7	hit:9570_conv:19141_3
I told my best friends about an incident in where I self-harmed recently.	1	hit:9571_conv:19143_1
Agreed. I was anxious and scared to share, but I'm glad I did; they were really supportive and it's helped me a lot.	1	hit:9571_conv:19143_3
They have, ever since I started taking meds and speaking to my doctor and social worker. This is also the reason why I think you should confide in a professional, it can really turn your life around and you deserve the best!	1	hit:9571_conv:19143_5

no, i don't believe that, whether you are having a bad day or not if you look at everything clearly you will see there is a next stage, just like birth death is a process	12	hit:10287_conv:20575_3
Not necessarily,  while it's true you have your traditional christian or Muslim that preach the afterlife as some miracle and hell, scaring people into not being themselves, but death isn't a scary phase, and i don't care about whether i am going to die, as that is just the ego trying to cling on and survive, i've passed that point, but after looking clearly you'll see there is more than just this dimension and that is just a simple fact, science tells us this too, it's not about feeling good or feeling comfortable with death, it's about growing	12	hit:10287_conv:20575_5
