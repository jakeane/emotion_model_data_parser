My friend lost her parents and siblings in a fire and their family was very close to mine. So seeing her go through the grief made me realize how thankful I should be	1	hit:173_conv:346_3
Yes definitely. Never take anything for granted as you never know when it will be taken away from you	1	hit:173_conv:346_5

I couldnt celebrate my 18th birthday as I had exams during the time and I felt terrible for it. But my friends threw a surprise party for me and it was the best!	7	hit:187_conv:375_1

As silly as it sounds, I was so surprised at how different my two kids were as babies. You're reminded that they're wired with their own personalities from the git-go.	7	hit:195_conv:391_1
One was pacifier, one was fingers. One wanted to co-sleep, one liked her space. One liked facing *out* in the Baby Bjorn carrier, one liked cocooning in a sling!	7	hit:195_conv:391_3

I visited an orphan once and it was such a surreal moment. It made me realise how thankful I should be for a family	1	hit:203_conv:407_1

But in the meantime -- the unspoken strain is NOT fun. But I'm glad to hear about a happy ending -- thank you for that!	9	hit:207_conv:414_5
I can still look back with shame at the way I treated a girl in sixth grade. I wasn't as bad as others, but that doesn't make me feel any better.	2	hit:208_conv:417_1

Unfortunately, she died. I only found out when Facebook first came out, and her brother and I "friended" one another.	2	hit:208_conv:417_5

When I was a kid, I went to this group with other kids my age, it was in a big gym. There were kids of different ages, and one of the kids (8 years old or so) was picking on the littler kids. So, when he had his back turned, I looped him with a hoola hoop and tripped him so he fell flat on his face.	0	hit:684_conv:1368_1
Yeah, I was pretty amazed in the moment, he was flat as a board in mid air before he landed flat on his face. I had to watch for a moment in awe, before I realized he was getting up and I was about to get smacked. So, I ran towards where the parents were seated, stopped when I turned the corner, and walked calmly over to my mom, taking a seat on her lap. I looked innocent as could be as the mean kid came around the corner, and I forced myself to sit still so that when he smacked me in the face with the hoola hoop, I looked like a helpless victim.	0	hit:684_conv:1368_3

I felt sooooo nervous going to my last job interview! Nerves must occur in proportion to how badly you *want* something!	3	hit:1573_conv:3146_1
I did! The company does something that I actually like -- a panel interview vs a series of one-on-ones. Have you ever had an interview like that?	3	hit:1573_conv:3146_3
It just means you're in a room with several representatives from different parts of the company. To me, that helps it feel more like a conversation -- and it's more time efficient too!	3	hit:1573_conv:3146_5

I once went to a doc appointment where I literally sat for three hours in the waiting room and then the doc only spent 5 min with me	6	hit:2828_conv:5657_1
I wouldn't have minded as much if he actually seemed to care.  If they make you wait and then spend alot of time with you that is one thing	6	hit:2828_conv:5657_3
Oh no he acted like I was bothering him by taking up his time!  It was so annoying!	6	hit:2828_conv:5657_5

Once in college this guy I was just friends with asked me out to get ice cream.  I could tell he really liked me and I didn't want to lead him on so I told him I had a headache.  I know that he knew I was lying and I still feel guilty to this day about that!	3	hit:2845_conv:5691_1

Last week I had Thai food for lunch, and it didn't sit well with my stomach. I had some explosive issues later in the day at work, and the bathroom was near all of my coworkers' cubicles. Needless to say, the stench ended the workday a little early.	10	hit:2851_conv:5702_1

Yes, exactly! My professor seemed to be a compulsive liar.

A huge step. But I'm done with renting and I have a lot of renovating plans in the works.	7	hit:3398_conv:6796_3
I'm the only one who cares about paying bills. It's very frustrating	6	hit:3398_conv:6797_1

I found an old picture in a box of my Great Grandparents.	15	hit:3419_conv:6839_1

I really am trying hard to- that's such a great suggestion. I know I'm making good progress to my goal, and I genuinely am pleased she did it!	2	hit:3564_conv:7128_3
I used to be soooooo territorial of my boyfriend (now husband of decades!) when were dating.	2	hit:3564_conv:7129_1

Absolutely! Of course, now the real work begins ;-) But her *knowing* that it was her hard work paid off in such a gratifying way -- ah, so happy for her!	8	hit:3571_conv:7143_3
I was disappointed when I realized someone close to me was not who I thought they were.	7	hit:3572_conv:7145_1
Well, in a sense. But to be fair, I may have had my own "vision" of who they were and held them to that standard -- not really seeing them for who they were. I have to accept some responsibility for that, you know?	7	hit:3572_conv:7145_3
I've definitely worked through that! Happily, it hasn't affected my ability to trust -- just inspired me to be more truthful with myself and others ;-)	7	hit:3572_conv:7145_5

It was wonderful. I felt at peace as I rode by all of the flower gardens and fountains. Do you visit any parks or gardens in your area?	13	hit:3945_conv:7890_3
It's so quiet in my house, just watching tv by myself. Wish my family was around.	11	hit:3948_conv:7897_1

Yes it is. I am glad that I was able to speak with her.	7	hit:3986_conv:7972_3
I love the adventure and perspective of living away from my home state -- but that doesn't mean I don't miss elements of it while I'm gone!	15	hit:3987_conv:7975_1

I went to the fride and was surprised to find what I thought was an ice cream cake.	4	hit:4678_conv:9357_1
It turned out to not even be an ice cream cake.  It was some kind of pinapple cake.  I still had a piece but it was disappointing.	4	hit:4678_conv:9357_3
I was surprised when my wife left me	2	hit:4681_conv:9363_1
We were married for 10 years	2	hit:4681_conv:9363_3
I was annoyed when my family missed my birthday	6	hit:4683_conv:9367_1
Yeah that's very true. Doesn't mean we aren't important though	6	hit:4683_conv:9367_3
Interestingly, I also had a job interview recently, although I've already heard back and I got it!	7	hit:4684_conv:9369_1

I had a terrifying experience what using the restroom yesterday.	12	hit:4685_conv:9370_1
As I was sitting on the toilet I kept hearing a scratching noise.  When I turned to look a huge waterbug had climbed up the tub wall next to me.	12	hit:4685_conv:9370_3
When I was younger, my dad got into a motor cycle accident. It made me not want to learn how to drive for almost 2 years.	3	hit:4685_conv:9371_1
I did learn, but it took a long time to overcome my fear. I'm glad I eventually did!	3	hit:4685_conv:9371_3
I had to replace my toilet the other day.  It was a new experience, and not altogether pleasant.	4	hit:4689_conv:9378_1
Yeah.  It wasn't terribly hard, but it definitely took watching a few videos to feel confident.	4	hit:4689_conv:9378_3
In college I was in a class with an older woman who stole my ideas for a paper.	0	hit:4693_conv:9386_1
It's ok.  I'm basically over it now, but it was really angering then.	0	hit:4693_conv:9386_3
I was grateful when I married my wife	1	hit:4693_conv:9387_1

My family and I are close to aquiring a new home.	7	hit:4694_conv:9389_1
IIt is an older home in need of some repairs.  We can't wait to get started on renovations.	7	hit:4694_conv:9389_3
I was excited when I bought my car	8	hit:4695_conv:9391_1
It was a mustang. I saved up enough money and purchased it outright	8	hit:4695_conv:9391_3
I was fast asleep this morning when my cat pounced on me and jolted me awake.	7	hit:4700_conv:9400_1
It came out of nowhere. I almost fell out of bed!	7	hit:4700_conv:9400_3
I'm feeling a little down right now. The weather is perfect, but I miss not going to the beach with my husband and dog and catching the sunset. Those were great times!	14	hit:4701_conv:9402_1
Yeah, we would take a bottle of wine with us, watch the surfers and just kick back. Wish those days would return.	14	hit:4701_conv:9402_3
Maybe one day. That was when I lived in Northern California - the best place on the planet, imho!	14	hit:4701_conv:9402_5
I am confident that I will win that spelling bee tomorrow	5	hit:4701_conv:9403_1

I've been trying lately to potty train my youngest daughter.	9	hit:4702_conv:9404_1
It's been a challenge.  Yesterday she got on the toilet herself though.  She said she didn't want to be a baby anymore.	9	hit:4702_conv:9404_3
My wife has been out of the country for school for a while.  Dropping her off at the airport was really hard.	11	hit:4707_conv:9414_1
Yeah, we talk by text all the time and call every day.  It's still hard though, we haven't been apart longer than a couple days since we met.	11	hit:4707_conv:9414_3
I was sad when my dog died	11	hit:4710_conv:9421_1

My wife is coming home after being out of the country for 2 months.  I can't wait!	8	hit:4712_conv:9424_1

It's going to be at my house. We are going to have a lot of food	15	hit:4717_conv:9434_3
I was terrified when I watched that horror movie	12	hit:4724_conv:9449_1
It was Scream	12	hit:4724_conv:9449_3
I was digging through some old stuff I had and I found letters that my wife wrote me when we were still dating. They were so sweet.	15	hit:4725_conv:9451_1
Yeah! It gave me all of the feels. I read through them and pretty much fell in love with her all over again.	15	hit:4725_conv:9451_3
I managed to spook myself really bad once watching too many horror movies and being in a house alone by the woods.	12	hit:4728_conv:9457_1
Yeah.  I kept thinking trees were people or things standing out in the woods.	12	hit:4728_conv:9457_3
I'm so proud of my wife	9	hit:4730_conv:9460_1
She really is	9	hit:4730_conv:9460_3

its okay. gave me an opportunity for a new adventure	0	hit:4731_conv:9463_5
I'm starting a new job next week, and while I am excited, I am also very nervous!	10	hit:4735_conv:9471_1
That's true, but the uncertainty always makes me feel a bit nervous.	10	hit:4735_conv:9471_3
I had to go out of town and leave my dogs with a friend, I was worried about them.	1	hit:4736_conv:9473_1
Yeah.  They annoyed my friend some, but overall it was fine.	1	hit:4736_conv:9473_3
My wife has been in Germany for 2 months.  I can't wait till she gets home.	11	hit:4738_conv:9477_1
It sucks, but it's best to keep busy with whatever you can.  Videogames helped a lot :P	11	hit:4738_conv:9477_3
My wife has been out of the country for 2 months.  She's coming back soon, but it's been tough without her.	11	hit:4739_conv:9479_1

I'm planning on moving to a new city, but I'm starting to get cold feet.	3	hit:4740_conv:9481_1
I'm just unsure about the city...like what if I'm miserable there?	3	hit:4740_conv:9481_3
One of the things I had to do when I started my job was be in charge of moving a department.  When we were doing it, one of my coworkers bailed on me.	0	hit:4741_conv:9482_1
There were others, but we needed all the help we could get.	0	hit:4741_conv:9482_3
Everybody say a quiet place movie was boring but i still decided to watch it and i was pretty impressed! That movie was so amazing, I feel like i was holding my breath the whole time	14	hit:4742_conv:9485_1
omg, you should! It's a one of a kind movie. I don't wanna spoil it, it's about aliens	14	hit:4742_conv:9485_3
it sure must be nice to be able to get all the cool stuff, and do whatever you want and not have to work for any of it.	2	hit:4743_conv:9487_1
Yeah me either. I have some friends that get to experience it. Fortunately they are sharing so that is nice.	2	hit:4743_conv:9487_3
I was disgusted when I noticed the food on the table	4	hit:4744_conv:9488_1
It was brussel sprouts and Liver	4	hit:4744_conv:9488_3

oh yea. Basically started the day we got him. That definitely helped.	9	hit:4749_conv:9499_3
Yes. I couldnt' handle a dog I have to keep shut up when people come over and stuff.	9	hit:4749_conv:9499_5
My friend just recently moved to California...It makes me sad because I have always wanted to live there.	2	hit:4750_conv:9501_1

When I was planning my wedding, the caterer we were trying to go with kept blowing us off and dodging communication.	0	hit:4753_conv:9506_1
Yeah, we dropped them with enough time to find someone else, but it was unnecessary stress we didn't need.	0	hit:4753_conv:9506_3
It is so frustrating having to deal with difficult customers that don't want to pay their bills?	0	hit:4755_conv:9510_1
Normally I would agree. It only seems to be a few here and there. Most of the time I dont have problems.	0	hit:4755_conv:9510_3

I woke up in the wee hours and thought I saw a person standing in the corner of my room.  It was just some clothes hanging on a door.	12	hit:4758_conv:9516_3
I'm very annoyed because my friend didn't give me my money back	6	hit:4760_conv:9520_1
Yes! it was to cover his rent and he was supposed to pay me back	6	hit:4760_conv:9520_3
I typically procrastinate when needing to pack for a trip. But this time I got my butt in gear and it's all done several days early.	15	hit:4761_conv:9523_1
Thanks. I usually get somewhere and realize I forgot a bunch of stuff I need cause I packed in a rush 30 minutes before leaving.	15	hit:4761_conv:9523_3
Fortunately, my wife usually comes to the rescue on me.	15	hit:4761_conv:9523_5
My wife was working yesterday, but she ended up taking the rest of the day off to spend time with me! I was shocked.	7	hit:4762_conv:9525_1
We did! We went out for lunch and hung out on the beach. It was very relaxing and a nice change.	7	hit:4762_conv:9525_3
I went to a restaurant my wife really likes with some friends while she was at work.  It's not a big thing, but I felt a little bad about it :P	3	hit:4763_conv:9526_1
Not like really bad, just kind of bad that I went somewhere my wife likes when she couldn't go.  It's not a big deal, but I feel bad when I do things like that.	3	hit:4763_conv:9526_3
That horror movie made me terrified	12	hit:4764_conv:9528_1

It is nice to have in-laws that are accepting and loving. So many people don't have a good relationship with their in-laws.	1	hit:4770_conv:9540_1
Aw I'm sorry. Mine is only a few years old but it's been smooth sailing so far.	1	hit:4770_conv:9540_3
I have been trying to get my oldest son to be more responsible.  I started out small by asking him to adopt a good sleep schedule.  After several weeks he still hasn't.	4	hit:4774_conv:9549_1
He does well enough in school.  I think that might make him think he doesn't need any disciple in everyday life.  Make me worry a bit.	4	hit:4774_conv:9549_3
My wife usually sniffs out anything going on, but I was able to successfully plan a surprise party for her without her knowing.	9	hit:4775_conv:9551_1
Yes. Friends, family, cake, all of it. Even one friend from out of town she hasnt seen in years.	9	hit:4775_conv:9551_3

I take some conselation in that, however my kids laugh when they hear thier dad scream like a girl at a flying roach.	12	hit:4778_conv:9556_3

As a momma's boy I always missed my mom anytime she was gone for an extended period of time.	11	hit:4779_conv:9558_1

The other day I framed the puzzle we used as a guest book at our wedding.	15	hit:4786_conv:9573_1
Etsy somewhere.  My wife bought it, so I don't really know which one, but you can find a bunch on there.	15	hit:4786_conv:9573_3
Well, what a trip that was. I just drove from Northern California to Florida. I just knew there would be no problems, and I was right.	5	hit:4790_conv:9580_1
Six days in all, but I wasn't rushing it. I wanted to see a bit of the country. It was amazing actually.	5	hit:4790_conv:9580_3
It's not so bad really. You get used to it. If you remember to stop and stretch now and again you're ok. And there are some decent rest areas, some with free coffee!	5	hit:4790_conv:9580_5
Oh yes. Anything to keep the eyes open and on the road!	5	hit:4790_conv:9580_7

I got upset at my oldest son's lack of motivation.  I feel bad that I got angry with him though.	3	hit:4802_conv:9605_1
True.  I just haven't found a way to yet.  Need to be more creative.	3	hit:4802_conv:9605_3
K and I went to see a house a while ago. I don't know what happened there, but when I went upstairs I became more and more nervous and eventually ran back downstairs and out the door. Scary or what.	12	hit:4807_conv:9614_1
It was as if something was telling me to get out. K had the same feeling in the basement. I've never had that happen before.	12	hit:4807_conv:9614_3

My eldest niece, who helps take care of her younger disabled sister, graduated high school with great grades recently. She works hard both at her studies and taking care of her sister - she deserves it.	9	hit:4814_conv:9629_1
Yes, I got her tickets for a show in London that she's been wanting to see. She lives in Scotland, so the journey isn't bad at all. She's taking a friend with her.	9	hit:4814_conv:9629_3
I do hope she has a wonderful time. It's not easy living in a family with a disabled sibling and she just takes it all in her stride.	9	hit:4814_conv:9629_5
I want to ask this girl I'm friends with out but I'm nervous to to so.	3	hit:4819_conv:9639_1
Problem is if she says no then it would make things weird between us.  I am afraid that either way I may not be able to see her again.	3	hit:4819_conv:9639_3

My rottweiler passes a lot of gas in the evenings.	4	hit:4824_conv:9648_1
Not so much.  It is such a thick scent and it follows you everywhere you go in the house.  I usually put him out when he starts it up.	4	hit:4824_conv:9648_3
It's been a long week! My husband has been out of town and its been just me and a cranky toddler.	11	hit:4826_conv:9653_1

I found an empty aile a went to zip up.  Just then a mom with kids comes around the corner.	10	hit:4833_conv:9667_3
It's been a hard day today, its so quiet in my house. I hate when my husband is out of town.	11	hit:4834_conv:9668_1
In a few months, he is in the military so he is gone a lot :( But I know he is doing it for our family and our country!	11	hit:4834_conv:9668_3
My young niece, who is disabled, was recently rushed to hospital. She's ok now but we were very worried for a while there.	13	hit:4835_conv:9671_1
Chest infection which, for her, can prove fatal. She had to go on a special oxygen machine till the antibiotics kicked in.	13	hit:4835_conv:9671_3

A few weeks ago a coworker called in sick. I had to work twice as long as I normally would.	6	hit:4845_conv:9690_1
It was, but it didn't help my feelings towards that coworker.	6	hit:4845_conv:9690_3
That is true, I just hope he was really sick. I hate it when I have to cover for people who are hungover.	6	hit:4845_conv:9690_5
My wife has been out of the country for school for 2 months.  I misread the calendar and thought she was getting back a week earlier than she is.	4	hit:4846_conv:9692_1
Yeah.  It could be worse, but it definitely put a cloud over things for half an hour or so.	4	hit:4846_conv:9692_3
It's been awhile since I lost my last job.  After two years of working my family and I are finally moving into a home of our own.	1	hit:4848_conv:9697_1
After such a long time we certainly will.  I can't wait to start making the house into our home.	1	hit:4848_conv:9697_3

No thankfully  I havent. I would never do it. Have you?	5	hit:4864_conv:9728_3
I was planning to view the stars last night, but it was storming. It was supposed to be the brightest that Jupiter will be in a while.	4	hit:4864_conv:9729_1

A new baby means a lot changes.  One of those is the amount of time my wife and I have together.	2	hit:4866_conv:9732_1
Agreed.  I know it's a necessary thing but I'm a little jealous of the time my wife spends with the baby.	2	hit:4866_conv:9732_3
My mom is so great! She is always there for me and her grandchildren. I can't think of anyone that loves us as much as she does!	13	hit:4867_conv:9734_1

Well, take this with a grain of salt, but it CAN be a blast. I put in $5 like I usually do, and on the first deal, I hit $1000. I went nuts, cashing out immediately and started shoving $20 bills in to everyone's hands and pockets!	8	hit:5469_conv:10938_3

YES.  *chuckle!*  School starts tomorrow here and it was absolutely insane.  The worst part was, usually I go to the store regularly before 10A because there's less people in there and I can just kinda stroll through the aisles.  Oh no, not today.  It was just about elbow to elbow!	15	hit:5499_conv:10999_3

I just enjoyed grocery shopping for the first time in a very long time. I've found my perfect restaurant/store and spent a very happy 40 mins or so wandering around it.	13	hit:7872_conv:15745_1
Yes, it's both. I got a chickpea curry with basmati rice that a local Indian lady made. And a bag of dragon tongue beans, which are delicious!	13	hit:7872_conv:15745_3
They're the same shape as regular green beans, but lighter in color and they have red streaks through them. You treat them as you would green beans.	13	hit:7872_conv:15745_5
What I love about this store is it sources all of its produce locally and its all organic. So you get some strange, different things to try!	13	hit:7872_conv:15745_7
I came home from work last night and my step dad scared me!	7	hit:7873_conv:15747_1

When I heard Anthony Bourdin had taken his own life, I was so shocked and upset. He gave so much pleasure to a lot of people, yet was miserable in his own life.	6	hit:7897_conv:15794_1
It's awful. I really wish far more resources were put toward mental health facilities and counselling in this country!	6	hit:7897_conv:15794_3
Most definitely. We actually need these resources to get mentally disturbed people off the streets and get them the help they deserve.	6	hit:7897_conv:15794_5
There's so much we could be doing to help those in need and yet our politicians (on both sides!) are off helping the rich and corporations - it's disgusting.	6	hit:7897_conv:15794_7

I remember being on holiday and trying to find a way to watch an F1 race. I caught the beginning of the race in a bar before it closed and saw that my favourite driver had had a puncture and fallen to last place. My mate asked me what the chances were of him winning from that position? I said 1000 to 1. By the time we were back at the hostel, I learned that he had indeed won the race in what many believe was the greatest single event in the sport's history!	7	hit:7910_conv:15821_1
Yeah, for sure! It was one of those nights where we were journey is what's fun rather than what you were aiming to do, if you get me.

My best friend's long-term relationship ended abruptly a while back, just after her father passed. I'm so full of admiration for her - instead of turning to drink or becoming crazy-depressed, she pulled herself together and made a new, exciting life her new reality.	9	hit:7949_conv:15898_1
Yes, she should. She joined a community garden and helps out there, she got a part time job and took up badminton - not something she'd ever done before!	9	hit:7949_conv:15898_3
She's a very strong person and she also has lots of friends and family to help her. She's a lovely person and deserves the best in life!	9	hit:7949_conv:15898_5

It's nice to think back, tho' and relive the old days. We have our own traditions now, but the good old days will always remain just that!	15	hit:7978_conv:15957_3

I was truly surprised when I notice my tire got hit by a rock, thought I wouldn't make it to the tire place in time	6	hit:12277_conv:24555_1

I feel like deepening my connection to God is the most important thing in my life	5	hit:12292_conv:24585_1
It's like if I don't get that sorted out I won't be able to live a fulfilling life	5	hit:12292_conv:24585_3
When I can't take a breather in the day I feel suffocated	7	hit:12297_conv:24595_1
Right, it's like I can't focus or relax	7	hit:12297_conv:24595_3

Yeah, I just had trouble socializing is all	2	hit:12301_conv:24602_3
When I do things that are challenging I feel more self-reliant. I recently tried taking an ice bath	5	hit:12307_conv:24614_1

Listening to old artists like they Might Be Giants is my jam	14	hit:12325_conv:24650_1
Haha, I didn't grow up with them but it's like discovering a gold mine that no one else seems to listen to	14	hit:12325_conv:24650_3

I was pretty disillusioned when I found out door to door sales wasn't a fun time	4	hit:12344_conv:24688_1

Yes, I'm exhausted. My daughter is teething so she hasn't been sleeping well.	2	hit:12347_conv:24695_3
Seeing people taken advantage of by fake religious services is something I find the most vile. It makes them believe that they're doing the right thing, but the person taking advantage of them knows what's really up. What do you know about that?	4	hit:12354_conv:24708_1
Exactly, I feel that getting people to believe irrational things is the same as giving them a brain virus, it'll slowly erode their ability to think rationally.	4	hit:12354_conv:24708_3

I had to leave my key in my car for the mechanic and I was left wondering if someone might find it	10	hit:12365_conv:24730_1

I got woken up by my roommate and I swear his voice is the last thing you want to hear in the middle of the night, sent the fear of God through my veins	12	hit:12379_conv:24759_1
I don't know, I didn't answer, pretended I was asleep	12	hit:12379_conv:24759_3
